      Warning in `validSpeciesParams()`:
      The species parameter data frame is missing a `w_max` column. I am copying over the values from the `w_inf` column. But note that `w_max` should be the maximum size of the largest individual, not the asymptotic size of an average indivdidual.

      Warning in `validParams()`:
      Your MizerParams object was created with an earlier version of mizer. You can upgrade it with `params <- upgradeParams(params)` where you should replace `params` by the name of the variable that holds your MizerParams object.
